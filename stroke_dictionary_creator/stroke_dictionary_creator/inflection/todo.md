- words like "ödeema" that seem to belong to both vocal harmony groups (this
  belongs to aou), also meri-merta(not mertä like it could be). There needs to
  be a good way to handle exceptions like this.

- adjective inflection. The kotus wordlist does not differentiate between nouns
  and adjectives, for example. The voikko list does, however.

- honorific "Te" conjugations for verbs

- derivations for verbs: laulaa-laulella and others
