# Agglutination in the Finnish steno system

> Agglutination is a linguistic process pertaining to derivational morphology in
> which complex words are formed by stringing together morphemes without
> changing them in spelling or phonetics

[Wikipedia: Agglutination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutination)

In simple terms, it means adding an affix to a word:

| Finnish          | English                                   |
| ----             | ----                                      |
| istua            | to sit down                               |
| istun            | I sit down                                |
| istahtaa         | to sit down for a while                   |
| istahdan         | I'll sit down for a while                 |
| istahtaisin      | I would sit down for a while              |
| istahtaisinko    | should I sit down for a while?            |
| istahtaisinkohan | I wonder if I should sit down for a while |

# Two phase word writing system

An agglutinated word in the Finnish steno system is written in two steps:

1. Write the body of the word
2. Add any number of affixes using extra strokes

Here are some simple examples (subject to change):

| Strokes      | Finnish  | English    | Notes                                      |
| ----         | ----     | ----       | ----                                       |
| `KOIR`       | koira    | a dog      |                                            |
| `KOIR / -N`  | koiran   | a dog's    | Add the genitive with the right side N key |
| `KOIR / -T`  | koirat   | dogs       | Plural                                     |
| `KOIR / -NT` | koirien  | dogs'      | Combined plural and genitive in one stroke |
| `KOIR / -L`  | koiralla | on the dog | Adessive                                   |
| `KOIR / -LT` | koirilla | on the dog | Combined plural and adessive               |

# Agglutination rules

Finnish has different kinds of affixes for different parts of speech ("classes"
of words). Each one of these uses unique affixes as well.

## Nouns, like `talo` (house)

There are 15 cases, some of which are in the plural.

| Strokes | Finnish      | English                | Pluralizable | Notes         |
| ----    | ----         | ----                   | :----:       | ----          |
|         | koira        | a dog                  | **✓**        | nominative    |
|         | koiran       | a dog's                | **✓**        | genitive      |
|         | minut        | me                     | **✓**        | accusative    |
|         | koiraa       | of a dog               | **✓**        | partitive     |
|         | koirana      | as a dog               | **✓**        | essive        |
|         | koiraksi     |                        | **✓**        | translative   |
|         | koirassa     | in a dog               | **✓**        | inessive      |
|         | koirasta     | from (inside) a dog    | **✓**        | elative       |
|         | koiraan      | (in)to a dog           | **✓**        | illative      |
|         | koiralla     | on a dog               | **✓**        | adessive      |
|         | koiralta     | from (on top of) a dog | **✓**        | ablative      |
|         | koiralle     | to (on top of) a dog   | **✓**        | allative      |
|         | koiratta     | without a dog          | **✓**        | abessive      |
|         | koirin       | with many dogs         | only plural  | instructive   |
|         | koirine + ni | with my dogs           | only plural  | comitative[1] |

[1]: the "ni" possessive suffix varies, changing the owner specified in the sentence.

*The goal is to make typing these as easy as possible.*

## Possessive suffixes, like `-ni` and `-si` (my and your)

A possessive suffix adds the notion of an owner to a sentence. They can be used
with nouns, adjectives and verbs too.

There are 4 cases for each part of speech:

* Nouns with possessive suffixes:

| Strokes | Finnish    | English        | Pluralizable | Notes      |
| ----    | ----       | ----           | :----:       | ----       |
|         | koirani    | my dog         |              | 1st person |
|         | koirasi    | your dog       |              | 2nd person |
|         | koiransa   | his/her dog    |              | 3nd person |
|         | koirassaan | in his/her dog | **✓**        | 3nd person |

* Adjectives with possessive suffixes:

| Strokes | Finnish    | English         | Pluralizable | Notes      |
| ----    | ----       | ----            | :----:       | ----       |
|         | kokoiseni  | my size         |              | 1st person |
|         | kokoisesi  | your size       |              | 2nd person |
|         | kokoisensa | his/her size    |              | 3nd person |
|         | koossaan?  | in his/her size |              | 3nd person |

`TODO: make sure the fourth form is applicable.`

* Verbs with possessive suffixes:

| Strokes | Finnish | English            | Pluralizable | Notes                       |
| ----    | ----    | ----               | :----:       | ----                        |
|         | syön    | I eat              |              |                             |
|         | syöt    | You (singular) eat |              |                             |
|         | syövät  | They eat           |              | Same as for the plural case |
|         | syömme  | We eat             |              |                             |
|         | syötte  | You (plural) eat   |              |                             |
|         | syödään | (It's) being eaten |              | Passive                     |

## Verbs

Verbs come in a couple of different varieties.

### Infinitive verbs

Infinite verbs are used like nouns:

* there are 5 different forms
* some can be either in active (I do, you do, they do) or in passive (is being
  done)
* in addition to this, some of the forms can only be inflected in one or too
  parts of speech. Others support all of them

There are a lot of examples at https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitiivi (in Finnish).

#### 1. Group `A, laulaa` (to sing)

Only supports the translative (`-ksi`).

| Strokes | Finnish      | English                     | Notes                      |
| ----    | ----         | ----                        | ----                       |
|         | laulaakseni  | so that I could sing        | 1st singular form (me)     |
|         | laulaaksesi  | ... you could sing          | 2nd singular form (you)    |
|         | laulaakseen  | ... He/she could sing       | 3rd singular form (he/she) |
|         | laulaaksemme | ... we could sing           | 1st plural form (we)       |
|         | laulaaksenne | ... You (plural) could sing | 2nd plural form (you)      |
             
#### 2. Group `E, laulaessa (while singing)`

Supports three parts of speech in the active, and one in the passive:

| Strokes | Finnish      | English       | Notes          |
| ----    | ----         | ----          | ----           |
|         | laulaessa    | while singing | inessive       |
|         | laulaen      | by singing    | instructive    |
|         | laulaesta    | from singing  | elative (rare) |
|         | laulettaessa |               |                |

Also it's possible to add a possessive suffix at the end for each of the active
cases (not for the passive, obviously), such as in the word `laulaessani` (while
I was singing).

#### 3. Group `MA, laulama(-tta)` (without singing)

The active form works with *all* forms of speech. Also it's possible to use the
possessive suffix.

Examples from Wikipedia (not all parts of speech are shown):

| Strokes | Finnish       | English                     | Notes                    |
| ----    | ----          | ----                        | ----                     |
|         | laulamassa    | in singing                  | inessive                 |
|         | laulamasta    | from singing                | elative                  |
|         | laulamaan     | toward singing              | illative                 |
|         | laulamaa+ni   | of something sung by myself | partitive + possession   |
|         | laulamalla    | by singing                  | adessive                 |
|         | laulamaksi    | to become sung by           | translative              |
|         | laulamakse+ni | to because sung by myself   | translative + possession |

The passive form works with the instructive case.

| Strokes | Finnish     | English                         | Notes       |
| ----    | ----        | ----                            | ----        |
|         | laulettaman | to be sung (by unknown singers) | instructive |

#### 4. Group `MINEN, laulaminen` (the act of singing, or just "singing")

Works with all parts of speech.

| Strokes | Finnish       | English     | Notes                                         |
| ----    | ----          | ----        | ----                                          |
|         | laulamise+mme | our singing | genitive, the first plural person as a suffix |

Does not work with the passive.

#### 5. Group `MAINEN, laulamaisillani (as I was about to start singing)`

Only works with the adessive.

| Strokes | Finnish           | English                          | Notes                                        |
| ----    | ----              | ----                             | ----                                         |
|         | laulamaisilla+ni  | (see title)                      | adessive, first singular person as a suffix  |
|         | laulamaisilla+an  | as he was about to start singing |                                              |
|         | laulamaisilla+nsa | as he was about to start singing | alternative way of writing, but same meaning |

Does not work with the passive.
