# Agglutination in the Finnish steno system

> Agglutination is a linguistic process pertaining to derivational morphology in
> which complex words are formed by stringing together morphemes without

In simple terms, it means adding an affix to a word:

| Finnish          | English                                   |
| ----             | ----                                      |
| istua            | to sit down                               |
| istun            | I sit down                                |
| istahtaa         | to sit down for a while                   |
| istahdan         | I'll sit down for a while                 |
| istahtaisin      | I would sit down for a while              |
| istahtaisinko    | should I sit down for a while?            |
| istahtaisinkohan | I wonder if I should sit down for a while |

## Two phase word writing system

An agglutinated word in the Finnish steno system is written in two steps:

1. Write the body of the word
2. Add any number of affixes using extra strokes

Here are some simple examples (subject to change):

| Strokes      | Finnish  | English    | Notes                                      |
| ----         | ----     | ----       | ----                                       |
| `KOIR`       | koira    | a dog      |                                            |
| `KOIR / -N`  | koiran   | a dog's    | Add the genitive with the right side N key |
| `KOIR / -T`  | koirat   | dogs       | Plural                                     |
| `KOIR / -NT` | koirien  | dogs'      | Combined plural and genitive in one stroke |
| `KOIR / -L`  | koiralla | on the dog | Adessive                                   |
| `KOIR / -LT` | koirilla | on the dog | Combined plural and adessive               |

## Agglutination rules

Finnish has different kinds of affixes for different parts of speech ("classes"
of words). Each one of these uses unique affixes as well.

### Nouns, like `talo` (house)

There are 15 cases, some of which are in the plural.

| Strokes | Finnish      | English                | Pluralizable | Notes         |
| ----    | ----         | ----                   | :----:       | ----          |

|         | minut        | me                     | **✓**        | accusative    |

|         | koirin       | with many dogs         | only plural  | instructive   |
|         | koirine + ni | with my dogs           | only plural  | comitative[1] |

[1]: the "ni" possessive suffix varies, changing the owner specified in the sentence.

*The goal is to make typing these as easy as possible.**
