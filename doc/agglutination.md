In simple terms, it means adding an affix to a word:

| Finnish          | English                                   |
| ----             | ----                                      |
| istua            | to sit down                               |
| istun            | I sit down                                |
| istahtaa         | to sit down for a while                   |
| istahdan         | I'll sit down for a while                 |
| istahtaisin      | I would sit down for a while              |

## Two phase word writing system

An agglutinated word in the Finnish steno system is written in two steps:

1. Write the body of the word
2. Add any number of affixes using extra strokes

Here are some simple examples:
