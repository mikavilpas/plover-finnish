In simple terms, it means adding an affix to a word:

| Finnish          | English                                   |
| ----             | ----                                      |
| istua            | to sit down                               |
| istun            | I sit down                                |
| istahtaa         | to sit down for a while                   |
| istahdan         | I'll sit down for a while                 |
| istahtaisin      | I would sit down for a while              |
| istahtaisinko    | should I sit down for a while?            |
| istahtaisinkohan | I wonder if I should sit down for a while |

# Two phase word writing system

An agglutinated word in the Finnish steno system is written in two steps:

1. Write the body of the word
2. Add any number of affixes using extra strokes

Here are some simple examples (subject to change):

| Strokes      | Finnish  | English    | Notes                                      |
| ----         | ----     | ----       | ----                                       |
| `KOIR`       | koira    | a dog      |                                            |
| `KOIR / -N`  | koiran   | a dog's    | Add the genitive with the right side N key |
| `KOIR / -T`  | koirat   | dogs       | Plural                                     |
| `KOIR / -NT` | koirien  | dogs'      | Combined plural and genitive in one stroke |
| `KOIR / -L`  | koiralla | on the dog | Adessive                                   |
| `KOIR / -LT` | koirilla | on the dog | Combined plural and adessive               |

# Agglutination rules

Finnish has different kinds of affixes for different parts of speech ("classes"
of words). Each one of these uses unique affixes as well.

Files in this directory list the different kinds of words that are possible to
generate.
