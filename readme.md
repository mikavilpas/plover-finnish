# A stenographic system for the Finnish language

## Project status

This is still in the design phase. Only recommended for people interested in
designing the system.

There is no project roadmap available at this time.

## Design principles

- **Ergonomic**, requires much fewer keystrokes than QWERTY typing
- **Intuitive** to pick up. A two stage writing system that is simple, yet
  powerful enough to serve advanced users
- **Consistent**, allowing the writing of even the most complicated words in the
  Finnish language with a basic set of rules
- **Fast** to use, with optional shortcuts for common words and phrases. The
  design goal is to support the dictation of real time speech.
- **Grammatically correct**. With a dictionary of most Finnish language words, a
  large number of spelling errors are avoided altogether
- **Customizable**. Add new words that are easy to remember for you. Add
  shortcuts for phrases that you use a lot.
