# A stenographic system for the Finnish language

## Project status

This is still in the design phase. Only recommended for people interested in designing the system.

There is no project roadmap available at this time.

## Design principles

- **Fast** to use
- **Ergonomic**, requires much fewer keystrokes than QWERTY typing
- **Consistent** way to write even the most complicated words in the Finnish language
- **Intuitive** to pick up, does not require many briefs to get started
